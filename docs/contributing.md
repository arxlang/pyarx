# Contributing

In order to be able to contribute, it is important that you understand the
project layout. This project uses the _src layout_, which means that the package
code is located at `./src/arx`.

For my information, check the official documentation:
https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/discussions/src-layout-vs-flat-layout/

Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated! Every little bit
helps, and credit will always be given.

You can contribute in many ways:

## Types of Contributions

### Report Bugs

Report bugs at https://github.com/arxlang/arx/issues.

If you are reporting a bug, please include:

- Your operating system name and version.
- Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
- Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

### Fix Bugs

Look through the GitHub issues for bugs. Anything tagged with “bug” and “help
wanted” is open to whoever wants to implement it.

### Implement Features

Look through the GitHub issues for features. Anything tagged with “enhancement”
and “help wanted” is open to whoever wants to implement it.

### Write Documentation

Arx could always use more documentation, whether as part of the official Arx
docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts, articles, and such.

### Submit Feedback

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at
https://github.com/arxlang/arx/issues.

If you are proposing a feature:

- Explain in detail how it would work.
- Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
- Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions are
  welcome :)

## Get Started!

Ready to contribute? Here’s how to set up `arx` for local development.

1. Fork the `arx` repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/arx.git
$ cd arx
```

3. Create the conda environment (using mamba or conda) and install the project:

```bash
$ mamba env create --file conda/dev.yaml
$ conda activate arx
$ poetry install
```

4. Create a branch for local development:

```bash
$ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
```

5. Now you can make your changes locally.

6. When you’re done making changes, check that your changes pass the linter and
   the tests:

```bash
$ makim tests.linter
$ makim tests.unit
```

7. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub:

```bash
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
$ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
```

8.  Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

## Pull Request Guidelines

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put your
   new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the feature to
   the list in README.rst.
3. The pull request should work for Python >= 3.8.1.

## Tips

To run a subset of tests:

```bash
$ pytest tests/test_io.py
```

## Release

This project uses semantic-release in order to cut a new release based on the
commit-message.

### Commit message format

**semantic-release** uses the commit messages to determine the consumer impact
of changes in the codebase. Following formalized conventions for commit
messages, **semantic-release** automatically determines the next
[semantic version](https://semver.org) number, generates a changelog and
publishes the release.

By default, **semantic-release** uses
[Angular Commit Message Conventions](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-format).
The commit message format can be changed with the `preset` or `config` options\_
of the
[@semantic-release/commit-analyzer](https://github.com/semantic-release/commit-analyzer#options)
and
[@semantic-release/release-notes-generator](https://github.com/semantic-release/release-notes-generator#options)
plugins.

Tools such as [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) or
[commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint) can be used
to help contributors and enforce valid commit messages.

The table below shows which commit message gets you which release type when
`semantic-release` runs (using the default configuration):

| Commit message                                                 | Release type     |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `fix(pencil): stop graphite breaking when pressure is applied` | Fix Release      |
| `feat(pencil): add 'graphiteWidth' option`                     | Feature Release  |
| `perf(pencil): remove graphiteWidth option`                    | Chore            |
| `fix(pencil)!: The graphiteWidth option has been removed`      | Breaking Release |

As this project uses the `squash and merge` strategy, ensure to apply the commit
message format to the PR's title.
